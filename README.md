## Introduction

An Exadata Cloud Service DB system consists of a quarter rack, half rack, or full rack of compute nodes and
storage servers, tied together by a high-speed, low-latency Infiniband network and intelligent
Exadata software. You can configure automatic backups, optimize for different workloads, and
scale up the system to meet increased demands.

The compute nodes are each configured with a virtual machine (VM). You have root privilege for
the compute node VMs, so you can load and run additional software on them. However, you do
not have administrative access to the Exadata infrastructure components, such as the physical
compute node hardware, network switches, power distribution units (PDUs), integrated lights-out
management (ILOM) interfaces, or the Exadata Storage Servers, which are all administered by
Oracle.

You have full administrative privileges for your databases, and you can connect to your databases
by using Oracle Net Services from outside Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. You are responsible for
database administration tasks such as creating tablespaces and managing database users. You
can also customize the default automated maintenance setup, including backups, and you have
full control of the recovery process in the event of a database failure.

These hands-on lab guides provide step-by-step directions to setting up and using your Exadata Cloud Service platform in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Lab 1 - 5 deals with setting up the infrastructure and connectivity to Exadata Cloud Service.

Labs 6 & 7 are geared towards Monitoring and Managing your Exadata Cloud Service databases.

Labs 8 - 10 are intended for Backup, Recovering and Migrating your databases.

Lab 11 - 12 onwards demonstrate advanced lab guides for Database Vault and advanced Data safe lab guides.

Lab 13 - 16 are additional labs which talks about connecting your Exadata Cloud Service databases with Python application, working with OCI CLI, build APEX applications and automating with Terraform.

# Workshop Overview

## Before You Begin
**What is Exadata Cloud Service?**

- Exadata Cloud Service is offered on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, within OCI regions.
- Exadata Cloud Service available in quarter Rack, Half Rack or full Rack configurations.
- Exadata rack in OCI includes DB nodes, storage nodes and Infiniband switches.
- The storage and compute nodes are connected via high bandwidth Infiniband network that
provides RDMA based storage access to the compute nodes.
- Exadata storage software runs on storage servers and offloads database SQL processing
overheads.
- Currently, a single VM per compute node is supported. It allows root access for customers
while protecting hardware and network, DB nodes are virtualized using Xen based OVM.
- Oracle Manages storage cells, switches, management or IB network while customer manages
database compute nodes.
- Exadata Cloud Service provides a control Plane, a Web-based self-service management
interface for Exadata cloud service provisioning and interactive access to service administration function
