# Lab 100: Provisioning a Marketplace HPC Cluster

## Introduction

In this lab you will be provisioning an HPC Cluster from the OCI Marketplace. The OCI Marketplace is a one-stop shop for a wide variety of industry solutions that can easily be deployed within our cloud console. Here you will be leveraging this marketplace for Automated HPC Cluster Deployment. The template from the marketplace provides a base for a High Performance Computing solution, including all necessary components to start a workload with minimum effort. As these labs progress, you will see how such a baseline can be integrated and utilized by third party applications to accelerate your workflow.

### Navigate to the OCI Marketplace
1. Search the marketplace for **HPC**

7. Click **Create**

**Note:** It will take approximately 15 minutes to provision the Stack.

### View the running Stack

Once you've created the Stack it will redirect you to a page where you can view the stack job running. It should look something like below. Here you can view:
 - **Logs**
 - **Variables** passed to or generated by the Teraform script
 - **Associated Resources** provisioned by the Teraform script
 - **Outputs**
 - **View State** of the job
